Grab Yer Assets (GYA) - Version History:

Special acknowledgments:
- OnePxl - Creating/hosting/providing the ’Fast Asset Store'
- Tiaan Geldenhuys - Providing the snippet for the throttled progress bar and other tidbits that he has been kind enough to offer.

--
-- IMPORTANT: *IF* UPGRADING from a version of GYA older than 2.15b20b ...
--

DELETE THE EXISTING INSTALL.  This will prevent a possible conflict during import as GYA’s project folder has been moved.

GYA’s User data has also been relocated.  IF you switch to a project with an older version of GYA, it WILL NOT have any of your User Settings until you upgrade GYA within that project as well.

--
-- NOTES:
--

EXPERIMENTAL: Experimental features are for testing purposes only and are separated in their own menu and prominently labeled as such.  These are features that are considered functioning but have not been fully tested as yet.  Use of these experimental features is purely at your own risk.

2.15e02a: Last version officially supported by Unity 3.x & 4.x.  Active development will focus on Unity 5.x

2.15c18c
- Added: ‘Menu->Maintenance->Clean up Outdated GYA Support Files’ to remove ANY outdated GYA related files including the ‘-Grab Yer Assets (Old)’ folder.
- Reorganized the Maintenance Menu
- Updated the GYA upgrade handling

Note:
After upgrading any/all projects that contain GYA you can run (2) menu items to finalize the upgrade:
1- Menu->Maintenance->Merge Old Assets from Old GYA Versions
2- Menu->Maintenance->Clean up Outdated GYA Support Files
Doing this will ensure that your Old Asset files have been moved if required AND clean up any remaining GYA related files.

This is NOT required for a typical Unity setup and is only provided to assist when a SymLink’d Asset Store folder has been detected or GYA has reported an error when moving the Old Assets folder.

2.15c16b
- Added: ‘Open URL of Selected Packages’ to multi drop-down, invalid assets will be ignored
- Updated: Improved error checks relating to symlinks.

2.15c15j
- Placed GYA’s supporting files/folder into it’s own folder:
'../Unity/Grab Yer Assets/Asset Store-Old’
'../Unity/Grab Yer Assets/GYA Settings.json'
'../Unity/Grab Yer Assets/GYA Assets.json'
- Added: ‘Menu->Maintenance’ sub-menu added, related maintenance functions have been moved under it.
- Added: ‘Menu->Maintenance->Merge Old Assets from Old GYA Versions’ will move Old Assets from the prior version of GYA to the new Old Asset folder if needed.  If you’re not using SymLinks for the Asset Store(s)/Old Assets folder, they will be moved to the new folder automatically.  Otherwise, you can run this routine manually to merge the Old Assets into the new folder when you are ready.
- Changed: Refresh Progress Bar default TRUE
- Improved SymLink handling

2.15c12c
- Added: ‘Remove from Current Group’ for removing Multiple Assets from a Group at one time
- Added: ‘Asset Store Packages’ to the Categories drop-down
- Changed: Sort ‘by Date’ to ‘by Date (File)’ = file creation date
- Added Sort ‘by Date (Publish)’ = internal publish date
- Added Sort ‘by Date (Package)’ = internal package build date

2.15c11c
- Added: Unitypackage creation date/time, (Ref/Req: Tiaan), this differs from the File creation date added prior

2.15c11b
- Fixed: Multiple Invert was functioning on the entire list when in a collection/group
- Changed: Optimized and cleaned up a bit of code

2.15c10g
- Fixed: GYA now detects if the Asset Store folder is a SymLink/Junction and will NOT attempt to move it’s data files, if required, if one is detected.  Useful information will be shown in the GYA window.
- Added: Error checks around menu items for when GYA detects an error.  Prevents possibly trying to access data that would not be there in a controlled error state.

2.15c08a
- Added: Two (2) Progress Bar toggles
	“Menu->Settings->Show during Refresh”, default = DISABLED
	“Menu->Settings->Show during File Actions”, default = ENABLED
- Changed: ”Menu->Settings->Show All Asset Store Folders" to default = ENABLED

2.15c06j -- Submitted
- Changed: Moved the new Packages & Folder entries to the top of the Categories section, to better portray their intent.  They are now labeled as “Show Actual Contained In:”.  These 4 entries will show what is ACTUALLY there regardless of the “Settings->Show All Asset Store Folders” so that there is always a quick way to get to these files even if you normally prefer to hide them from the current version of Unity that is running.

2.15c06h
- Added: Under the Search bar drop-down, “Sort->by Package ID”

2.15c06g
- Added: Settings option “Open URLs In Unity”, ENABLED by default
- Added: Improved permission handling to copy/move functions

2.15c06f
- Changed: ”Menu->Settings->Scan All Asset Store Folders", default is now ENABLED.
 1- ENABLED = Scan both the "Asset Store" and "Asset Store-5.x" folders.
 2- DISABLED = Scan "Asset Store" if running Unity 3/4 ..OR.. Scan "Asset Store-5.x" if running Unity 5, automatically determined at run-time.
- Added: ”Menu->Settings->Show All Asset Store Folders", default is DISABLED.
 1- DISABLED = Show "Asset Store" if running Unity 3/4 ..OR.. Show "Asset Store-5.x" if running Unity 5, automatically determined at run-time.
 2- ENABLED = Show both the "Asset Store" and "Asset Store-5.x" folders.

2.15c06a
- NOT-ENABLED: ‘scannedFolders’ tag to the json file to note the last scanned AS folder and if it matches GYA’s settings for the current Unity version.  This is to auto refresh data when switching between Unity versions.  Disabled this in lieu of the changes made in 2.15c06f

2.15c05f
- Added: Right-click drop-down “Copy Path To Clipboard” for selected asset or by clicking on one of the asset versions listed below for it’s path
- Added: Main menu, there is now a ‘*’ after the currently active Asset Store folder just as a quick visual reference.
- Fixed: ‘Persist Mode’ will now only copy a newer version of itself if the package.unity_version is <= Application Unity version.  This will prevent a Unity 5 version from being copied into the Unity 4 Standard Assets for example.

2.15c05d
- Fixed: A possible Windows error when moving the User file.
- Fixed: A possible permissions error when attempting to move the Old Assets folder.
- Added: ”Menu->Settings->Scan All Asset Store Folders", default is DISABLED.

  2- “To Unity 4 Asset Store”, will move ANY assets located in the NEW “Asset Store-5.x” folder over to the OLD “Asset Store” folder, EXCEPT Unity 5 specific assets.  Duplicates between the (2) folders will be left untouched at this time.
  3- “Delete Empty Sub Folders”, will scan BOTH Asset Store folders and remove any empty sub-folders & delete any “.DS_Store” files if it is the only file within the folder.
- Added: Unity 4 specific Categories:
  1- “Packages: Unity 4” = Packages that are tagged as being Unity 4 or older as per the “unity_version” tag AND any packages that do NOT have the “unity_version” tag.

2.15b17b
- Moved: GYA Data Files have been moved for better handling with Unity 5,
  Old location: “../Unity/Asset Store/”
  New location: “../Unity/”
  What was moved: “Grab Yer Assets.json”, “Grab Yer Assets User.json” and the “-Grab Yer Assets (Old)” folder

2.15b17a
- Fixed: Asset color in the list may have been incorrect when handling duplicate and/or old versions between the “Asset Store” & “Asset Store-5.x” folders

2.15a29a -- Submitted
- Duplicate files within “Asset Store” and “Asset Store-5.x” handled properly

2.15a26c
- GYA now scans the “Asset Store-5.x” folder as well if it exists.
- Changed: ‘Package Info’ last line has been changed from showing the assets collection to showing it’s folder path.

2.15a20a
- Updated: Now handles the ‘Standard Assets’ (Unity 5b19+) folder in addition to ’Sample Assets’ (Unity 5b14-b18) & ‘Standard Packages’ (Unity 3-4) depending on the version of Unity being used
- Changed: Deleting an individual asset will no longer reset marked assets
- Fixed: Issue with null being returned if the ‘Asset Store’ folder is empty

2.15a01e -- Submitted
- Fixed: Auto Consolidate is functioning as expected.

2.15a01c -- Submitted
- Added: Unity 5 handling as follows:
- IMPORTANT - While standard assets folder is optional when installing Unity 5, this is required for GYA's 'Persist Mode' to work.  Without the folder, GYA will NOT be able to update itself, nor will it show up under 'Assets->Import Package'!
- If running under versions OLDER than Unity 5, GYA will look for and use the 'Standard Packages' folder.
- If running under Unity 5 or NEWER, GYA will look for and use the 'Sample Assets' folder.
- References to 'Standard' regarding the 'Standard Packages' folder have changed to reflect the difference between Unity 5 and older versions.  GYA will now show 'Standard Packages' for versions older then Unity 5 and 'Sample Assets' for Unity 5 and newer as appropriate throughout the UI.
- GYA will now dynamically rescan the Standard Packages/Sample Assets folder when loading the existing JSON file.  This is to ensure that the proper folder is displayed in the UI even when changing back and forth between versions of Unity.
- Update: Refreshing in Offline Mode will now reload the current Offline version of the JSON file.

2.14k26a -- Submitted
- Updated: Fast Asset Store URL

2.14j15a -- Submitted
- Changed: How GYA handles multiple copies of the same asset with the same version in the AS folder.  While this should never occur unless files are manually duplicated outside of GYA, it now prevents both copies from showing as Old versions.

2.14j13a
- Fixed: When right-clicking on an asset, titles of old versions that had a '/' in it would create sub-menus.

2.14j10c -- Submitted
- Added: 'Damaged Packages' under the Categories drop-down.  To refresh, a damaged package typically just has a detectable problem in the embedded JSON header and generally does not cause a problem when importing.

2.14j09b
- Changed: If asset version is detected in the asset title, the version will not be appended when shown in the list.

2.14j08a
- Added: An optional URL for checking asset details: the 'Fast Asset Store'
1) Via the main menu, will show the Daily-Deal.
2) Via right-clicking an asset, will show the asset related info without the extra overhead of the full Unity Asset Store.

- Added: Any asset files that are detected as being damaged will now show an error icon on the right side of the list.
- Changed: Official Asset Store assets that have a MISSING or BLANK 'title' will by default use the filename in place of the title.  If other versions of the same asset exist, it will use that title if possible.

2.14i13b -- Submitted
- HotFix: For handling a BLANK 'title' in the embedded JSON of an Asset Store package.  Asset Store packages with missing title's will show up in the list as '0 BAD FILE (pkgFilename) pkgVersion'.  I will work on a more elegant solution for the next update.

2.14i11a
- Added: 'Load Alternate GYA Data File' allows for loading a GYA data file from another machine for use in offline mode
- Added: 'Offline Mode' Prevents the data from being automatically overwritten when starting GYA or pressing the Refresh button.  Disable to return to normal functionality.

Note:
Offline Mode is primarily meant for testing or reference.
Refreshing is disabled when in Offline Mode.
As expected, asset related file operations will fail if the actual files are not accessible to the machine running in offline mode.

2.14i06c -- Submitted
- Added: 'Export as CSV' to export a complete list of assets

2.14i02c

2.14h23a
- Added: 'Delete ALL Selected' to the Multiple Asset drop-down

2.14h20a
- Fixed: Right clicking from one asset to the next may not have highlighted the new line or updated it's info in the popup
- Fixed: When clicking away from a popup, it would pass the click thru, which had the affect of marking the line unintentionally

2.14h17e
- Updated: Re-worked the menu code to be easier to follow along with internally
- Fixed: Upgraded the menu system to account for slight variances between OS X & Windows

2.14h15a -- Submitted

- If the file Newtonsoft.Json.dll exists in the current GYA folder, it will be automatically removed as it is no longer needed.
- The class 'AssetsImport' has been renamed to 'GYAAssetsImport' to be less generic in naming

2.14h12e
- EXPERIMENTAL: 'Auto Protect Asset Store Files' - Prevents Asset Store Updates from overwriting the existing asset files when updating.  Already downloaded updates will be preserved without interfering with newer updates/downloads.
- EXPERIMENTAL: 'Auto Delete Consolidated' - Automatically deletes Old files from the Old Assets folder

2.14h12b
- Added: 'Auto Consolidate' - Automatically moves Old files to the Old Assets folder

- Fixed: Old & Old To Move Assets may not have shown the correct color in Windows

2.14g26a
- Standardized some of the menus for better consistency
- Extended error reporting on damaged package headers can be toggled via the menu (DISABLED by default, GYA will still report an error count when refreshing)

- Fixed: Possible User file corruption if GYA v1 was used after having upgraded to v2

2.14g09b
- Testing: GYA now handles unity packages within the local project directory structure, these are unique to each project.  Any local assets will show up at the top of the All collection.  Only updated when clicking Refresh at this time.
- Assets with a leading space or non-alphanumeric character are being trim’d so they fall in alphabetically.  It will still show the leading space or non-alphanumeric character in the displayed list.
