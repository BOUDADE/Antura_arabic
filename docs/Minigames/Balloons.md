## Warnings to be fixed

**tons of**:
- [Warning] [BalloonsGame] [OnPoppedNonRequiredBalloon] Animator has not been initialized.
- [MakeWordPromptGreen] Animator has not been initialized.
- [Warning] [LetterPromptController] [OnStateChanged] Animator


## Optimization

there are many deactivate GameObjects.
some are very big, like `Environment_old` can they be deleted?
