# Install and Configure

## Requirements
- Unity latest 5.5.x, Mac or Windows computer
(it works on Unity 5.6 and 2017, but for some glitches in a couple of shaders and the need to update TextmeshPro to the relative versions)

## Optional
- [SR Debugger](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/27688) plugin for in-app debug tools
- iOS or Android device (the app runs well in the desktop editor or desktop build)

## Fetch the Project

1.  Get Unity latest 5.5.x stable (Win or Mac) from <http://unity3d.com/get-unity/update>
2.  Download the project. There are two ways:
    A) the **simple** is to download the zipped package (from Clone or Download green button)
    B) the **advanced** is to use a Git client to track the changes and update the project as it gets developed:
    - Install a free GitHub client (<https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/> is good for developers, <https://desktop.github.com/> is a simpler one for anybody)
    - fetch the project from this repository <https://github.com/vgwb/Antura_arabic> (you can read <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/> for some help using GitHub Desktop)
3.  Install the required external plugins (TextMeshPro)
4.  **Play**. Once you have the EA4S_Antura_U3D folder in your computer, open it in Unity, open scene `_app/_Start` and press Play ;)

## Editor Setup

set the Build Setup to Desktop, iOS or Android platform.

then set the Game window to **16:9** (under iOS there is a preset called iPhone 5 Wide (16:9))
