- [DeveloperGuildeines](DeveloperGuildeines.md).md* describes general guidelines for developers that want to contribute to the project.
- [Logging](Logging.md) describes the implementation and use of the Logging System.
- [Minigames](Minigames.md) describes how to create and structure new minigames and how to correctly link them to the core application.
- [PlayerProfile](PlayerProfile.md) describes how the Player Profile Manager works, a subsystem that allows the use of several profiles on the same device.
- [ProjectStructure](ProjectStructure.md) describes the structure of the Unity3D project.
